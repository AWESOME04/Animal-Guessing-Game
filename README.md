This is my final kibo project for the future proof with Python project. It is a Python based guessing game where users give various facts about animals. 
Final Project for Kibo's Future Proof with Python program.

This quiz game uses a function; a block of code with a name that performs a specific task. A function allows you to use the same code several times, without having to type everything each time. Python has a lot of built-in functions, but it also allows you to create your functions.

The program should continue to check if there are any questions to ask and if the player has exhausted all his chances. The score is stored in a variable during the game. Once all the questions have been answered, the game ends.]
